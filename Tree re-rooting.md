### What is Re-rooting DP?
Re-rooting DP is a technique used in tree problems where:
1. You calculate some property (e.g., sum of distances) for a specific root node.
2. You then "re-root" the tree at each of its children and efficiently calculate the property for the new root using the previously computed values.

This avoids recalculating the property from scratch for each node, reducing the complexity from \(O(n^2)\) (naive approach) to \(O(n)\).

---

### Why is "Tree Distances II" a Re-rooting Problem?

1. **Initial Calculation for Root**:
   - You calculate the sum of distances from the root node (e.g., node 1) to all other nodes using a DFS.
   - This gives the base case for the re-rooting process.

2. **Re-rooting Transition**:
   - When you move the root from a node \(a\) to one of its children \(b\), the distances to nodes in \(b\)'s subtree decrease by 1, while the distances to nodes outside \(b\)'s subtree increase by 1.
   - This transition can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{ans}[b] = \text{ans}[a] - \text{subtree}[b] + (n - \text{subtree}[b])
     \]
   - This formula efficiently updates the sum of distances for the new root \(b\) without recalculating everything.

3. **Final Result**:
   - After re-rooting at every node, you have the sum of distances for all nodes in \(O(n)\) time.

---

### Why Re-rooting is Necessary
Without re-rooting, you would need to calculate the sum of distances for each node independently, which would involve \(O(n)\) work per node, leading to \(O(n^2)\) complexity. Re-rooting allows you to reuse previously computed values, making the solution efficient.

---

### Summary
Yes, this is a re-rooting problem. The solution involves:
1. Calculating the sum of distances for the root node using a DFS.
2. Using a re-rooting formula to efficiently compute the sum of distances for all other nodes in \(O(n)\).

define some special re-rooting problem?
</user>
<assistant>
A **special re-rooting problem** refers to a tree problem where the re-rooting technique is applied, but the properties being calculated or the transitions between nodes involve unique or non-standard computations. These problems often require creative adaptations of the re-rooting technique.

Here are some examples of **special re-rooting problems**:

---

### 1. **Tree Distances II (Sum of Distances)**
- **Problem**: Calculate the sum of distances from each node to all other nodes in the tree.
- **Re-rooting Transition**:
  \[
  \text{ans}[b] = \text{ans}[a] - \text{subtree}[b] + (n - \text{subtree}[b])
  \]
  - Nodes in \(b\)'s subtree get closer by 1.
  - Nodes outside \(b\)'s subtree get farther by 1.

---

### 2. **Maximum Path Sum in a Tree**
- **Problem**: Find the maximum path sum in a tree, where the path can start and end at any two nodes.
- **Re-rooting Transition**:
  - Use a combination of subtree maximums and parent contributions to calculate the maximum path sum for each node.
  - Transition involves propagating the maximum path sum from the parent to the child while considering the contribution of the child’s subtree.

---

### 3. **Count of Nodes at Distance \(k\)**
- **Problem**: For each node, count the number of nodes that are exactly \(k\) distance away.
- **Re-rooting Transition**:
  - Maintain a frequency array for distances in the subtree.
  - When re-rooting, adjust the frequency array to account for nodes moving closer or farther.

---

### 4. **Tree Diameter**
- **Problem**: Find the diameter of the tree (longest path between any two nodes).
- **Re-rooting Transition**:
  - Use two DFS passes:
    1. First DFS to find the farthest node from an arbitrary root.
    2. Second DFS from the farthest node to calculate the diameter.
  - This is a simpler form of re-rooting where the property being calculated is the maximum depth.

---

### 5. **Tree Coloring Problem**
- **Problem**: Given a tree where each node has a color, calculate the number of unique colors in the subtree of each node.
- **Re-rooting Transition**:
  - Use a set or frequency map to track colors in the subtree.
  - When re-rooting, adjust the set/map to account for nodes moving between the parent’s and child’s subtrees.

---

### 6. **Subtree XOR Problem**
- **Problem**: For each node, calculate the XOR of all values in its subtree.
- **Re-rooting Transition**:
  - Use the XOR property: \(a \oplus a = 0\).
  - Transition involves removing the child’s contribution from the parent’s XOR and adding the parent’s contribution to the child’s XOR.

---

### 7. **Tree Centroid Decomposition**
- **Problem**: Decompose the tree into centroids and calculate properties like distances, paths, or subtree sizes for each centroid.
- **Re-rooting Transition**:
  - Centroid decomposition involves recursively removing centroids and recalculating properties for the remaining subtrees.

---

### Characteristics of Special Re-rooting Problems
- **Unique Properties**: The property being calculated is not a simple sum or count (e.g., XOR, coloring, etc.).
- **Complex Transitions**: The transition formula between parent and child involves non-trivial adjustments.
- **Custom Data Structures**: Some problems require advanced data structures like frequency arrays, sets, or segment trees to handle transitions efficiently.

### Tree Re-rooting: A Detailed Explanation

Tree re-rooting is a powerful technique used to solve problems where you need to calculate some property for every node in a tree, and the property depends on the structure of the tree. Instead of recalculating the property from scratch for each node, re-rooting allows you to reuse previously computed values efficiently.

---

### Key Concepts of Tree Re-rooting

1. **Rooting the Tree**:
   - Choose an arbitrary node as the root (commonly node 1).
   - Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to calculate the desired property for the root node.

2. **Re-rooting Transition**:
   - When moving the root from a node \(a\) to one of its children \(b\), adjust the property for \(b\) based on the property of \(a\).
   - This adjustment is typically derived from the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\) (e.g., subtree sizes, distances, etc.).

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The first DFS calculates the property for the initial root in \(O(n)\).
   - The second DFS propagates the property to all other nodes in \(O(n)\), making the overall complexity \(O(n)\).

### Example Problem: Sum of Distances in a Tree

#### Problem Statement
Given a tree with \(n\) nodes, calculate the sum of distances from each node to all other nodes.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Calculate the Sum of Distances for the Root Node
- Use a post-order DFS to calculate:
  - `subtree[node]`: The size of the subtree rooted at `node`.
  - `subSum[node]`: The sum of distances from `node` to all nodes in its subtree.

#### Step 2: Re-root the Tree
- Use a pre-order DFS to calculate the sum of distances for all other nodes using the formula:
  \[
  \text{ans}[b] = \text{ans}[a] - \text{subtree}[b] + (n - \text{subtree}[b])
  \]
  - Nodes in \(b\)'s subtree get closer by 1.
  - Nodes outside \(b\)'s subtree get farther by 1.

### Clean Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;

const int N = 200001; // Maximum number of nodes

int n; // Number of nodes
vector<int> g[N]; // Adjacency list for the tree
int subtree[N]; // Size of the subtree rooted at each node
ll ans[N]; // Answer for each node (sum of distances to all other nodes)

// First DFS: Calculate subtree sizes and sum of distances for the root
ll dfs(int node, int parent) {
    subtree[node] = 1; // Each node is part of its own subtree
    ll distance_sum = 0; // Sum of distances for the current node
    for (int child : g[node]) {
        if (child == parent) continue; // Skip the parent
        distance_sum += dfs(child, node); // Recursively calculate for the child
        subtree[node] += subtree[child]; // Add the child's subtree size
    }
    distance_sum += subtree[node] - 1; // Add distances to all nodes in the subtree
    return distance_sum;
}

// Second DFS: Re-root the tree and calculate answers for all nodes
void calc(int node, int parent) {
    for (int child : g[node]) {
        if (child == parent) continue; // Skip the parent
        // Re-root the tree at the child
        ans[child] = ans[node] - subtree[child] + (n - subtree[child]);
        calc(child, node); // Recurse for the child
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n; // Input number of nodes

    // Input the tree edges
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        g[a].push_back(b);
        g[b].push_back(a);
    }

    // Calculate the sum of distances for the root node
    ans[1] = dfs(1, -1);

    // Re-root the tree and calculate answers for all nodes
    calc(1, -1);

    // Output the answers
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        cout << ans[i] << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **DFS Function**:
   - Calculates the size of each subtree (`subtree[node]`).
   - Calculates the sum of distances from the root to all nodes in its subtree (`subSum[node]`).

2. **Re-rooting Transition**:
   - When moving the root from \(a\) to \(b\):
     - Subtract the contribution of \(b\)'s subtree from \(a\)'s answer.
     - Add the contribution of the rest of the tree to \(b\)'s answer.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The first DFS runs in \(O(n)\) to calculate the initial values.
   - The second DFS runs in \(O(n)\) to propagate the values to all nodes.
