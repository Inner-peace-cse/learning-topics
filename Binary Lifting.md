### Binary Lifting: Detailed Explanation and Visualization

Binary Lifting is a powerful technique used in tree algorithms to efficiently compute answers to queries related to the ancestors of a node. It is particularly useful in solving problems like finding the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes, or determining the k-th ancestor of a node in logarithmic time.

### **Key Observations**

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - A tree is a connected acyclic graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges.
   - Each node (except the root) has a unique parent.

2. **Ancestor Representation**:
   - For each node `u`, we can precompute its ancestors at powers of 2 (e.g., 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^k).
   - This allows us to "jump" upwards in the tree in logarithmic steps.

3. **Binary Representation**:
   - Any number can be represented as a sum of powers of 2. For example, `13 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0`.
   - Using this property, we can compute the k-th ancestor of a node by combining precomputed ancestors at powers of 2.

4. **Precomputation**:
   - A sparse table is built where `up[u][j]` represents the 2^j-th ancestor of node `u`.
   - If `up[u][j]` does not exist (e.g., for the root node), it is set to `-1`.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - Precomputing the table takes `O(n * log(n))` time.
   - Querying the k-th ancestor or LCA takes `O(log(n))` time.

### **Steps in Binary Lifting**

1. **Precomputing the Sparse Table**:
   - Start with the immediate parent of each node (`2^0` ancestor).
   - Use dynamic programming to compute higher powers of 2:
     ```
     up[u][j] = up[up[u][j-1]][j-1]
     ```

2. **Answering Queries**:
   - To find the k-th ancestor of a node:
     - Decompose `k` into powers of 2.
     - Jump upwards in the tree using the precomputed table.

3. **Finding LCA**:
   - Lift both nodes to the same depth.
   - Use binary lifting to find the lowest common ancestor.

### **Visualization**

Consider the following tree:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     /|   |
    4 5   6
```

- **Sparse Table (`up`):**
  ```
  up[4][0] = 2   (2^0 ancestor of 4 is 2)
  up[4][1] = 1   (2^1 ancestor of 4 is 1)
  up[4][2] = -1  (2^2 ancestor of 4 does not exist)
  ```

- **Query Example**:
  - Find the 3rd ancestor of node `4`:
    - Decompose `3` as `2^1 + 2^0`.
    - Jump: `4 -> 2 (2^0)` -> `2 -> 1 (2^1)`.
    - Answer: `1`.

### **Advantages of Binary Lifting**

1. **Efficiency**:
   - Handles large trees with millions of nodes efficiently.
   - Reduces the complexity of ancestor queries from `O(n)` to `O(log(n))`.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Can be adapted for various tree-related problems, such as distance queries, path queries, and more.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Works well for both small and large trees.

### **Code Example**

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of Binary Lifting for k-th ancestor queries:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 100005;
const int LOG = 20; // log2(MAXN)

vector<int> tree[MAXN];
int up[MAXN][LOG];
int depth[MAXN];

void dfs(int node, int parent) {
    up[node][0] = parent; // 2^0 ancestor
    for (int j = 1; j < LOG; j++) {
        if (up[node][j - 1] != -1) {
            up[node][j] = up[up[node][j - 1]][j - 1];
        } else {
            up[node][j] = -1;
        }
    }
    for (int child : tree[node]) {
        if (child != parent) {
            depth[child] = depth[node] + 1;
            dfs(child, node);
        }
    }
}

int kthAncestor(int node, int k) {
    for (int j = 0; j < LOG; j++) {
        if (k & (1 << j)) {
            node = up[node][j];
            if (node == -1) break;
        }
    }
    return node;
}

int main() {
    int n = 6; // Number of nodes
    tree[1] = {2, 3};
    tree[2] = {4, 5};
    tree[3] = {6};

    // Initialize
    for (int i = 0; i < MAXN; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < LOG; j++) {
            up[i][j] = -1;
        }
    }

    // Precompute
    depth[1] = 0;
    dfs(1, -1);

    // Query
    cout << "3rd ancestor of 4: " << kthAncestor(4, 3) << endl; // Output: 1
    return 0;
}
```

### **Conclusion**
Binary Lifting is a versatile and efficient technique for tree-based problems. By precomputing ancestors at powers of 2, it enables logarithmic-time queries for tasks like finding k-th ancestors or LCAs. With its simplicity and power, it is a must-know tool for competitive programming and algorithmic problem-solving.
